# Spam Email Detection

This repository contains code for a spam email detection system using machine learning techniques. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately classify emails as spam or non-spam (ham).

## Overview

## Features

- Preprocessing text data using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization.
- Training and evaluating is done on machine learning model Logistic Regression.
